BattleShips Web
------
* This is an attempt to create an online way to play battleships with a game of battleships I have created in ruby. 
* This "should" be playable online over 2 separate computers and against a computer player if I have time to try and create an AI. 
* I will be using what I have learnt recently in Javascript and databases to make the website better.

To Save on typing I will assume you know the rules of battleships
